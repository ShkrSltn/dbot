# Legacy Pages

This folder contains pages that are no longer used in the main application but are kept for reference.

## Files:

- `profile_builder.py` - Old profile builder page
- `enrichment_demo.py` - Demo page for statement enrichment
- `batch_enrichment.py` - Batch processing demo
- `quiz.py` - Legacy quiz implementation
- `chatbot.py` - Chat functionality (moved here as not currently used)
- `user_quiz_slider.py` - Alternative quiz implementation with sliders

These files have been removed from the main navigation and routing but can be restored if needed.
